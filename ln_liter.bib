  abstract = {Summary This work is devoted to non-linear eddy current problems and
	their numerical treatment by the so-called multiharmonic approach.
	Since the sources are usually alternating currents, we propose a
	truncated Fourier series expansion instead of a costly time-stepping
	scheme. Moreover, we suggest to introduce some regularization parameter
	that ensures unique solvability not only in the factor space of divergence-free
	functions, but also in the whole space H(curl). Finally, we provide
	a rigorous estimate for the total error that is due to the use of
	truncated Fourier series, the regularization technique and the spatial
	finite element discretization.},

	Serial: Frontiers of Nonlinear Optics{\textless}/a{\textgreater}
	{\textless}/p{\textgreater}Nonlinear photonic-crystal microresonators
	offer unique fundamental ways of enhancing a variety of nonlinear
	optical processes. This enhancement improves the performance of nonlinear
	optical devices to such an extent that their corresponding operation
	powers and switching times are suitable for their implementation
	in realistic ultrafast integrated optical devices. Here, we review
	three different nonlinear optical phenomena that can be strongly
	enhanced in photonic crystal microcavities. First, we discuss a system
	in which this enhancement has been successfully demonstrated both
	theoretically and experimentally, namely, a photonic crystal cavity
	showing optical bistability properties. In this part, we also present
	the physical basis for this dramatic improvement with respect to
	the case of traditional nonlinear devices based on nonlinear Fabry-Perot
	etalons. Secondly, we show how nonlinear photonic crystal cavities
	can be also used to obtain complete second-harmonic frequency conversion
	at very low input powers. Finally, we demonstrate that the nonlinear
	susceptibility of materials can be strongly modified via the so-called
	Purcell effect, present in the resonant cavities under study.},

  abstract = {We report on the efficient nonlinear optical interactions in AlGaAs
	strip-loaded waveguides with a wafer composition specifically designed
	to increase the nonlinear coefficient. We demonstrate a broad-band
	self-phase modulation with a nonlinear phase shift up to 6$\pi$,
	and four-wave mixing with a 20-nm tuning range and signal-to-idler
	conversion efficiency up to 10 dB. Our samples are several times
	shorter than similar devices used for wavelength conversion by XPM
	and FWM in previous reports, but the efficiency of the observed effects
	is similar. Our experimental studies demonstrate the high potential
	of AlGaAs for all-optical networks.},

	{\textless}/p{\textgreater}We review recent research on nonlinear
	optical interactions in waveguides with sub-micron transverse dimensions,

	from glasses or semiconductors, provide the maximal confinement of

	The combination of these two properties make photonic nanowires ideally

	of single-cycle pulses and optical processing with sub-mW powers.},

	allows separating the problem in multiple, coupled subproblems which

  abstract = {Presented in this paper is a fast method to accurately model finite
	arrays of arbitrary three-dimensional elements. The proposed technique,
	referred to as the array decomposition method (ADM), exploits the
	repeating features of finite arrays and the free-space Green's function
	to assemble a nonsymmetric block-Toeplitz matrix system. The Toeplitz
	property is used to significantly reduce storage requirements and
	allows the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to be applied in accelerating
	the matrix-vector product operations of the iterative solution process.
	Each element of the array is modeled using the finite element-boundary
	integral (FE-BI) technique for rigorous analysis. Consequently, we
	demonstrate that the complete LU decomposition of the matrix system
	from a single array element can be used as a highly effective block-diagonal
	preconditioner on the larger array matrix system. This rigorous method
	is compared to the standard FE-BI technique for several tapered-slot
	antenna (TSA) arrays and is demonstrated to generate the same accuracy
	with a fraction of the storage and solution time.},

  abstract = { The behavior of an electromagnetic field in the neighborhood of the
	common edge of angular dielectric or conducting regions is determined
	from the condition that the energy density must be integrable over
	any finite domain (the so-called edge condition). Two cases are treated
	in detail 1) A region consisting of a conducting wedge and two different
	dielectric wedges with a common edge. 2) A region consisting of two
	different dielectric wedges with a common edge. It is also shown
	that near such edges, electrostatic and magnetostatic fields will
	exhibit the same behavior as the electromagnetic field.},

	is to develop a coanalyses methodology to address both electromagnetic
	(EM) and thermal effects for modeling high power integrated circuit
	(ICs), package and printed circuit boards (PCB). We use non-conformal
	domain decomposition method (DDM) for both electric and thermal analysis
	of high-power ICs. Non-conformal DDM decomposes the original problem
	domain into several non-overlapping sub-domains and thus can be effective
	for solving multiscale engineering problems. Furthermore, in the
	current approach, the thermal cooling is performed through heat sinks
	with both natural convection and air forced convection cooling.},
